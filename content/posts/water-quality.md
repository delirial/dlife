We can characterize water with some parameters:
- Temperature
- Ca concentration
- PH
- Carbonates alcalinity
- Estabilizers (CYA)
- TDS

## PH
This measure tell us the acidity of a solution. The scale for ph goes from 0 to 14. Where the middle is the acidity of the water, 7 ph. The equation of PH is:
```
pH = âˆ’log ([H+])
```
where **H+** is the quantity of hidrogen ions. 

## ORP
ORP is the acronym for **Oxidation-reduction potential**. This measure help us to undestand the sanitization of the water. It measure the capacity that have a solution to reduction or oxidation. 

### Redox

Redox is this capacity.

### Intervals
OMS put minimals values of ORP at 650 mV, but more volts, best water.

## TDS 
TDS is the acronym for **Total dissolve solids**. This sensor can measure the minerals concentration in ppm that have a solution. It measure the electroconductivity, capturing the
