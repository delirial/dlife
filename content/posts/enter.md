# Intro
This document will be my first post. I was searching a lot, what could be the best way to learn, remember and improve my thoughts about information technologies and others wonders of my interests. 

I will try with blogging in other language. ~~I don't know the moment when i realized that this can be a good path~~, but anyway, i think that it can worth the try.

# Objectives
I hope that this way of thinking and synthetise for other people make me happy about my progress and see dark spot about myself to improve and learn. Also my native language is Spanish, but lately i don't think that exist the concept on *native* language, i think on that like my **first** language actually. But in a territorial perspective maybe make more sense.

Organize and classify what i learned. I'm pursuing `AWS Professional Cert` so i want to make a **cloud series** and some *channels* about differents application contexts like **IOT**, **Marketing** and so on.
