This document will be my first post. I was searching a lot, what could be the best way to learn, remember and improve my thoughts about information technologies and others wonders of my interests. 

I will try with blogging in another language. ~~I don't know the moment when i realized that it can be a good path~~, but anyway, i think that it can worth the try.

# Objectives
I hope that this way of thinking and synthetise for other people make me happy about my progress and see dark spot about myself to improve and learn. Also my native language is Spanish, but lately i don't think that exist the concept on *native* language, i think on that like my **first** language actually. But in a territorial perspective maybe make more sense.

Organize and classify what i learned. I'm pursuing *AWS Professional Certification* but i want to make a **cloud series** and some *channels* about differents application contexts like **IOT** ,**Marketing** and others trendings. 

# Park
First thing first. I feel the needs to think on workspace. Like any other coder, i need hardware and software to do jobs. Hardware is like private home plants, so i don't write of it, but software is like public park. All coders known about software in a lot of ways, from deep understanding to remember only the graphics. This can leverage me to describe my ideal park ( any computer that can own ) with plants, animals, trees, lakes and natural spaces. 

## Plants

I like to thinking in software like natural processes of understanding differents contexts. For example, plants understand very well about climate; light, water, nutrients, humidity, etc, but nothing about planets mechanics or space dynamics. However, the plants live in a planet but doesn't matter, their lifes only need to know about a little context to adapt to the ambient, very complex but less than space mechanics. With this idea in mind, i understand all pieces of software like plants in an greenhouse. We need to know about the ambient build on greenhouse to understand the plants, but we can known about the plants without known about the ambient. It's a complex relationship between differents systems, but it's is here where the adventure begins. 

## Trees

## Lakes

## Animals

## Space

I start describe how i do organize my work with this landscape.
